With this private project I attempted to recreate/copy an existing website without looking at the original source code (recreate it by just looking at the actual site in my browser). The existing website that I set out to recreate was a template I took from Themezy.com. Working like this enables me to focus solely on practicing my code, and focus less on design-specific matters.

DISCLAIMER: This website is a personal recreation of an already existing website template which is designed by Themezy.com. I do not claim ownership nor credit for the design and all rights belong to Themezy.com. I have used their template for educational purposes only and again do not claim it as my own.

Personal notes on project:

- Lately I have been focused solely on learning Javascript and in doing so had neglected to practice writing HTML and CSS. It had been 21 days since I last wrote a website, and I noticed I was very rusty. This is a very simple webpage, and where I would not have had any problems at all 21 days ago, I now found myself struggling here and there. This tells me daily practice is vital.

- I am still struggling with classnames and I think the names I give to my classes would be somewhat confusing to another programmer.

- I think I have the tendency to use too many DIV's / use them where they are not required. Somehow it feels satisfying to keep making divisions, but I recognize it is a bad habit because if you have two programs doing the exact same thing then the program with the simpler and more minimalist code would have the better architecture.

- I am having a lot of fun writing lines of code - even if it is just HTML and CSS - and thus it is important to do it daily, not just to keep up the skill-level but also because having fun is an important factor in learning something more easily and thus more efficiently.

- Still not using GIT correctly. And the names I add to my commits are just rediculous.
